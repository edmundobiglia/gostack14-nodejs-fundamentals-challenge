<h3 align="center"><i>Node.js Fundamentals</i> Challenge - GoStack 14 Bootcamp</h3>

This is the challenge for **Level 2 Module 1: Node.js Fundamentals** of RocketSeat's **GoStack 14** bootcamp. The challenge assessed knowledge of the concepts covered by the module on working with **TypeScript** and **Repository-Service pattern** on a Node.js backend.

The challenge consisted of setting up a basic backend for a personal finance management app. We had to handle GET requests to retrieve a list of financial transactions and current balance, as well as POST requests to create new transactions. In the routes module we had to instantiate the transactions repository, which handled fetching, creating and persisting transactions. For creating transactions via POST, we had to implement a service for validation to allow expenditure creation only if there is sufficient balance.

### ðŸ§  Concepts Tested:

- TypeScript concepts (typing, interfaces etc.)
- Repository/Service pattern
- Error handling
